      <p class="lead">
        My name is London Sawada. I’m currently in school for nursing, previously served in the Navy, and am definitely not the greatest artist of all time. This started because I didn’t know how to flirt, so I learned how to draw instead. I was born in Pocono Mountain, Pennsylvania, grew up between there and Japan, and now study in North Carolina. Cosminuity is an alias I made when I was younger that stuck as the label behind my art and animation. I’m taking my time building a story, figuring things out as I go.

          <h3>What I do</h3>
          <p>I design characters, sketch worlds, experiment with animation, and slowly try to make everything connect.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Tools</h3>
          <p>I work digitally using Clip Studio, Photoshop, and the Flipaclip app. Sketch first, figure it out later.</p>

        <h3>How this started</h3>
        <p>
          This started the way most bad ideas start. I drew something once, got a little encouragement, and kept going. There was no plan and still isn’t one. Cosminuity just became the place where all my unfinished ideas ended up living.

        <h3>What I care about</h3>
        <p>
          I care more about personality than perfection. If something feels alive, a little weird, or slightly uncomfortable in a good way, I’m interested. Clean art is nice. Memorable art is better.
        </p>

        <h3>What I’m working on</h3>
        <p>
          I’m trying to build a story without forcing it. Characters come first, then settings, then maybe a plot if I’m lucky. Most of the time I’m just figuring out who these characters are and why they exist.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Why animation</h3>
        <p>
          Animation keeps me honest. If a design only works in one still frame, it usually falls apart the second it moves. Motion exposes bad ideas very quickly, which is painful but useful.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Where this is going</h3>
        <p>
          I don’t have a roadmap or a master plan. I’m aiming for steady progress, better decisions, and fewer abandoned folders. If this turns into something bigger, great. If not, I’m still learning a lot.
